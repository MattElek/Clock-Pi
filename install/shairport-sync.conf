// Sample Configuration File for Shairport Sync
// Commented out settings are generally the defaults, except where noted.

// General Settings
general =
{
name = "Clock-Pi"; // This means "Hostname" -- see below. This is the name the service will advertise to iTunes.
//		The default is "Hostname" -- i.e. the machine's hostname with the first letter capitalised (ASCII only.)
//		You can use the following substitutions:
//				%h for the hostname,
//				%H for the Hostname (i.e. with first letter capitalised (ASCII only)),
//				%v for the version number, e.g. 3.0 and
//				%V for the full version string, e.g. 3.0-OpenSSL-Avahi-ALSA-soxr-metadata-sysconfdir:/etc
//		Overall length can not exceed 50 characters. Example: "Shairport Sync %v on %H".
//	password = "secret"; // leave this commented out if you don't want to require a password
//	interpolation = "basic"; // aka "stuffing". Default is "basic", alternative is "soxr". Use "soxr" only if you have a reasonably fast processor.
//	output_backend = "alsa"; // Run "shairport-sync -h" to get a list of all output_backends, e.g. "alsa", "pipe", "stdout". The default is the first one.
//	mdns_backend = "avahi"; // Run "shairport-sync -h" to get a list of all mdns_backends. The default is the first one.
//	port = 5000; // Listen for service requests on this port
// 	udp_port_base = 6001; // start allocating UDP ports from this port number when needed
//	udp_port_range = 100; // look for free ports in this number of places, starting at the UDP port base (only three are needed).
//	statistics = "no"; // set to "yes" to print statistics in the log
drift_tolerance_in_seconds = 0; // allow a timing error of this number of seconds of drift away from exact synchronisation before attempting to correct it
resync_threshold_in_seconds = 0; // a synchronisation error greater than this number of seconds will cause resynchronisation; 0 disables it
//	log_verbosity = 0; // "0" means no debug verbosity, "3" is most verbose.
//	ignore_volume_control = "no"; // set this to "yes" if you want the volume to be at 100% no matter what the source's volume control is set to.
volume_range_db = 30 ; // use this advanced setting to set the range, in dB, you want between the maximum volume and the minimum volume. Range is 30 to 150 dB. Leave it commented out to use mixer's native range.
//	volume_max_db = 0.0 ; // use this advanced setting, which must have a decimal point in it, to set the maximum volume, in dB, you wish to use.
//		The setting is for the hardware mixer, if chosen, or the software mixer otherwise. The value must be in the mixer's range (0.0 to -96.2 for the software mixer).
//		Leave it commented out to use mixer's maximum volume.
//	regtype = "_raop._tcp"; // Use this advanced setting to set the service type and transport to be advertised by Zeroconf/Bonjour. Default is "_raop._tcp".
//	playback_mode = "stereo"; // This can be "stereo", "mono", "reverse stereo", "both left" or "both right". Default is "stereo".
//	alac_decoder = "hammerton"; // This can be "hammerton" or "apple". This advanced setting allows you to choose
//		the original Shairport decoder by David Hammerton or the Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) decoder written by Apple.
//	interface = "name"; // Use this advanced setting to specify the interface on which Shairport Sync should provide its service. Leave it commented out to get the default, which is to select the interface(s) automatically.

//	pipe_name = "/tmp/shairport-sync-metadata";
//	pipe_timeout = 5000; // wait for this number of milliseconds for a blocked pipe to unblock before giving up
//	socket_address = "226.0.0.1"; // if set to a host name or IP address, UDP packets containing metadata will be sent to this address. May be a multicast address. "socket-port" must be non-zero and "enabled" must be set to yes"
//	socket_port = 5555; // if socket_address is set, the port to send UDP packets to
//	socket_msglength = 65000; // the maximum packet size for any UDP metadata. This will be clipped to be between 500 or 65000. The default is 500.
